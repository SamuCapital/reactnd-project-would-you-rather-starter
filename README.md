# Would You Rather Project

This Project was built as part of the Udacity React developer nanodegree course. It represents a Would You Rather App with a simulated asynchronous API and lets the user create polls, vote and view the leaderboard.

- install all project dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`
- start the project with `yarn start` or `npm start`

Note: Due to Udacity requirements there are some specific implementations:

- the Redux connect HOC has been used instead of Redux Hooks
- there is no direct poll interaction on the home page
